## Blogging Again
For the ten billionth time, I'm getting back into blogging after an extended hiatus. I needed some time to reflect on what I was learning and what I intend to learn next. For a time I decided to specialize in Meteor, and I likely still will, but I want to make sure I start to learn new programming languages.  And since I'm an intrapersonal learner, I have to take special care to document what I'm learning and give myself code assignments/exercises.

## Languages and Paradigms
My interest has been thoroughly peaked by Haskell and front-end functional programming languages like PureScript and Elm. However, I have an abiding love for C and have recently decided to add Rust to my repertoire (if possible). And while I know there are only so many hours in the day, I can't shake this feeling.

So... for now I'm going to continue writing sample applications for [Meteor Academy](http://meteor.academy) while learning JavaScript, Haskell and C. And when I get bored (which will happen eventually), I'll dabble in some newer languages. Mostly the functional ones.

## Game Development
Not to mention, that since I've decided to actually learn game development, I'll likely be working with some small C# scripts in [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com). I've downloaded some extensions from the Asset Store that may help me avoid manual scripting for the sake of prototyping, but I likely won't be able to avoid it completely. I'm hoping visual scripting will take some of the edge off.

## Technical Writing
The more I learn, the more I'll share.
